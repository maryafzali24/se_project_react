# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

About the project: This application is pretty simple, a call is made to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

Improvements: Users are able to add their own clothing selections for different weather types. They are also able to switch between fahrenheit and celsius.

Users can now switch between two pages, the homepage and a profile page which houses all the clothing cards. Also the weather card now changes images based on the current weather.

## Tools and Technology Used

This application currently uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.
A mock server is currently used for data, which will eventually be pulled from an actual database.
